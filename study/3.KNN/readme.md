### Classification
#### [1.mnist-digit-recongnition](./1.mnist_digit_recongnition.py)
**Note**: Our goal is to correctly recognize numbers from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

**Dataset Info:**
MNIST handwritten digit recognition is a 'hello world' level dataset in the computer vision field.
Containning grayscale image  of handwritten digit from 0 to 9.

- Each image has a height of 28 pixels and a width of 28 pixels, totaling 784 pixels. 

- Each pixel has a value range of [0, 255], where a higher value indicates a darker color for that pixel. 

- The training dataset (train.csv) consists of 785 columns. The first column is the "label" indicating the handwritten digit that the image represents. The remaining 784 columns represent the pixel values of the image.
