       "' The Old Man and the Sea is a novel written by Ernest Hemingway. It tells the story of an old fisherman named Santiago who has not caught a fish in 84 days. He goes out to sea alone and catches a giant marlin, but struggles to bring it back to shore. Despite his determination, the fish is eventually eaten by sharks. Santiago returns to shore exhausted and defeated, but with a newfound respect from the villagers. The novel explores themes of perseverance, struggle, and the relationship between man and nature.'"
