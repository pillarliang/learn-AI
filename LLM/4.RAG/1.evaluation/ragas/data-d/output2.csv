"What is the first major issue mentioned in the Unity Agenda that the President plans to address, and what actions does he propose to take to combat it?","['an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \n\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \n\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \n\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \n\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \n\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \n\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \n\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \n\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \n\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \n\nLet’s get it done once and for all. \n\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \n\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \n\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \n\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \n\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \n\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \n\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \n\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop']","The first major issue mentioned in the Unity Agenda is the opioid epidemic.

What is the significance of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in the context of rebuilding America's infrastructure and its potential impact on job creation and competitiveness in the 21st century?,"['. \n\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \nthan ever before in the history of America. \n\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  \n\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \n\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \n\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \n\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \nand the middle out, not from the top down.  \n\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \n\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. \n\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that. \n\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. \n\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. \n\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. \n\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade. \n\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.  \n\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. \n\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. \n\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. \n\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. \n\n4,000 projects have already been announced. \n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. \n\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. \n\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. \n\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century \nto make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. \n\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. \n\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. \n\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. \n\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. \n\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it. \n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \n\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \n\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \n\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \n\nBut that�']","The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is the most sweeping investment in American history aimed at rebuilding the country's infrastructure.

May God protect our troops.', 'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \n\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \n\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \n\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \n\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \n\nThey keep moving.   \n\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \n\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \n\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \n\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. \n\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \n\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \n\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   \n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \n\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \n\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \n\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \n\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. \n\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. \n\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. \n\nTogether with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. \n\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.  \n\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.   \n\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.  \n\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. \n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.  \n\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. \n\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. \n\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. \n\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance.

拜登总统的政策如何平衡促进经济增长与降低家庭开支，通过制造业投资、降低育儿费用并打击价格操纵？,"[' the VA already does. \n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \n\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \n\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \n\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \n\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \n\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \n\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \n\nAll of these will lower costs. \n\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \n\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \n\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \n\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \n\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. \n\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. \n\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \n\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \n\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \n\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \n\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \n\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \n\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \n\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \n\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \n\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \n\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \n\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \n\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \n\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \n\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \n\nThat ends on my watch. \n\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \n\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and', '�s just the beginning. \n\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \n$20 billion to $100 billion. \n\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \n\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \n\nAnd we will really take off. \n\nAnd Intel is not alone. \n\nThere’s something happening in America. \n\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story. \n\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.   \n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \n\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \n\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \n\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \n\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \n\nIt’s time. \n\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \n\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \n\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \n\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \n\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \n\nLook at cars. \n\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \n\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \n\nSo—we have a choice. \n\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \n\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \n\nLower your costs, not your wages. \n\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \n\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \n\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \n\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \n\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \n\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \n\nI call it building a better America. \n\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \n\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \n\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \n\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday.

"What policy recommendations, integrating fair pay and pandemic measures, target worker well-being, school resumption, and public safety, with a focus on bipartisan collaboration and tackling gun control, voting rights, and police reform?","[' apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \n\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \n\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \n\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \n\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \n\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \n\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \n\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \n\nBut I also know this. \n\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \n\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \n\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \n\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \n\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \n\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \n\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \n\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \n\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \n\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \n\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \n\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \n\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \n\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \n\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \n\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office. ', '  \n\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \n\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \n\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \n\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \n\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \n\nI will soon send Congress a request. \n\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \n\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \n\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \n\nAnd we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \n\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \n\nI know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \n\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \n\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \n\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \n\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \n\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \n\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \n\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \n\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \n\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \n\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \n\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \n\nWe cannot let this happen. \n\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—']",政策建议包括：通过Paycheck Fairness Act并提供带薪休假。提高最低工资至每小时15美元，并扩大儿童税收抵免，以防止家庭生活在贫困中。增加Pell Grant，增加对HBCU（黑人学院和大学）的支持，并投资社区学院。推动PRO Act，允许工人在多数人支持下组建工会。投资工人，从底层和中层出发重建经济。应对COVID-19，包括提供疫苗、治疗、测试和口罩，以及‘Test to Treat’计划。准备应对新变种，确保学校和商业的重新开放。继续全球疫苗接种。强调团结，反对党派分歧，投资于犯罪预防、社区警察和社区安全，支持枪支管控，如背景检查、禁止攻击武器和大容量弹匣，以及改革选举法，保障投票权。,multi_context,"[{'source': './test.txt'}, {'source': './test.txt'}]",True
"How have Intel's $100B investment, along with Ford's $11B and GM's $7B, collectively impacted job growth, economic expansion, and US manufacturing's supply chain strength, considering effects on inflation, production capacity, and offshoring dynamics?","['�s just the beginning. \n\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \n$20 billion to $100 billion. \n\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \n\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \n\nAnd we will really take off. \n\nAnd Intel is not alone. \n\nThere’s something happening in America. \n\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story. \n\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.   \n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \n\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \n\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \n\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \n\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \n\nIt’s time. \n\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \n\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \n\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \n\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \n\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \n\nLook at cars. \n\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \n\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \n\nSo—we have a choice. \n\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \n\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \n\nLower your costs, not your wages. \n\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \n\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \n\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \n\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \n\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \n\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \n\nI call it building a better America. \n\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \n\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \n\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \n\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \n\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \n\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like', '. \n\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \nthan ever before in the history of America. \n\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  \n\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \n\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \n\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \n\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \nand the middle out, not from the top down.  \n\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \n\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. \n\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that. \n\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. \n\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. \n\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. \n\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade. \n\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.  \n\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. \n\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. \n\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. \n\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. \n\n4,000 projects have already been announced. \n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. \n\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. \n\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. \n\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century \nto make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. \n\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. \n\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. \n\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. \n\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. \n\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it. \n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \n\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \n\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \n\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \n\nBut that�']","Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger announced an increase in investment from $20 billion to $100 billion, which, along with Ford's $11 billion investment in electric vehicles and GM's $7 billion investment in electric vehicles, has led to the creation of over 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in the US last year. These investments signal a revitalization of American manufacturing, with companies choosing to build factories in the US instead of overseas. The increased investments and job growth are expected to boost production capacity, strengthen the supply chain, and potentially reduce the need for offshoring. However, the pandemic's impact on hiring and global supply chains is still a factor contributing to inflation, as mentioned by the President, who aims to address this by increasing domestic production and innovation.",multi_context,"[{'source': './test.txt'}, {'source': './test.txt'}]",True
